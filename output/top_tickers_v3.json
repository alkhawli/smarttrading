It\u2019s a general purpose tool that\u2019s very simple to start using and requires zero setup and almost zero support.  Competitors include Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery etc\n\nCompare this to $PLTR which is really an analysis / data integration platform that\u2019s highly customized to users (so far mostly government) and has historically had a huge consulting requirement to setup.  \n\n$Ddog is also not a good comparison as it is an application, stack and now database monitoring toolset.  \n\nSo, who are the good comparisons /competitors? IBM Watson springs to mind.  But probably the best i can think of that\u2019s publicly traded is Alteryx $AYX.

Would you like to hold RIVN at $165 if it were to drop to realistic valuations? And how long are you willing to hold it at $165 to recoup your loss?",

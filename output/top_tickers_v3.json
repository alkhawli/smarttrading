Gimmicky.\n\nThere was no way Apple could overthrow Nokia with their massive resources.\n\nTrue story, not that long ago - 2007 (less than 15 years ago) Nokia was worth over $150bn. Their profits was over $7bn euro.\n\nIn 2007, AAPL had a record year yet their profits was $3.5bn which was less than half of Nokia's profit. People still didn't believe Apple after they grew from just $266 million profit in 2004.\n\nSeems like a repeat of the mobile phone industry. People laughing at these new companies.\n\nPeople were also laughing at Tesla's valuation (and still are).\n\nYet, every year Tesla is gaining ground on other automakers. They are making more cars and more profits.\n\nPeople are laughing at Rivian now. \n\nI know better than to laugh at the market. Because in 10 years Volkswagen and Toyota could be replaced by new companies.\n\nIt's happened with IBM, Intel, Nokia, GE, Sony etc.\n\nSometimes companies fall when they fail to keep up with the times. Sometimes they try to adapt but they still lose market share anyway because the new players are just better at the new game than they are.\n\nMicrosoft tried to compete in the mobile market. A giant. Yet they lost.\n\nNokia at its peak was less than 200bn. Yet Apple is $2.5 trillion today.\n\nPeople say Tesla is worth x times more than current automakers. This must be overvalued. \n\nBut look at Apple. It doesn't even have the majority market share globally. Yet their profits are on a different scale to the rest.\n\nTesla might be able to monetize cars like Apple did consumer electronics. Fat margins. (already have the biggest margins)\n\nInvesting while limiting new companies to what current companies are capable of is selling them short. \n\nI'm not invested in EV. However, if in 5 years from now, Tesla's profits are the biggest in the industry, I won't be one of the Nokia fanboys that have seemingly disappeared and pretended they never existed (there were a lot of them)",

Thanks for the write up and you rightly point to the need for excellent commercial execution\n\nI think we should be very clear on who the peers are for $PLTR.  \n\nIn no way is $SNOW a peer. Snowflake is a next generation, true cloud database . It\u2019s a full SAAS model and it\u2019s extremely strong at data analytics (though it can do true database work in a pinch).   It\u2019s a general purpose tool that\u2019s very simple to start using and requires zero setup and almost zero support.  Competitors include Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery etc\n\nCompare this to $PLTR which is really an analysis / data integration platform that\u2019s highly customized to users (so far mostly government) and has historically had a huge consulting requirement to setup.  \n\n$Ddog is also not a good comparison as it is an application, stack and now database monitoring toolset.  \n\nSo, who are the good comparisons /competitors? IBM Watson springs to mind.  But probably the best i can think of that\u2019s publicly traded is Alteryx $AYX.  However Palantir is much \u201cheaver\u201d even that Alteryx\n\nAnyone have some better comp ideas?",

So your comments are irrational in your disgust. \n\nAs far as over valued yes right now there isn't a single IPO and or new company that isn't over valued and or unreasonably high, welcome to the world of dreams and forecasts. \n\nLucid doesn't want to ramp up to quickly like Tesla did and there are still tremendous complaints about tesla's fit and finish. Lucid is taking the German and Japanese approach to building automobiles. The ramp up will increase as demand stabilizes and their product shines. \n\nThe Mercedes EQS is around the corner to start production deliveries also and I imagine they won't hit much more than 20k first year either. \n\nIf you want to complain about truly over valued under delivered look at rivian. Now that's insanity but the modern world is all pipe dreams. However it shows people want change and financials will float it. Beautiful truck btw and once again will be very unlikely to produce 20k in volume first year. \n\nSo long story short.... What's your short? .... I mean what's your point grumpy butt?",

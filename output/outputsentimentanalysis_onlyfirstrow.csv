39,"Agree completely.  Each time you can sell a stock for a decent profit....Do it and don't look back.  Looking back and overly criticizing, not looking critically but actually  overly criticizing,  your trading strategy is not good for your psyche.  It causes you to plunge deeper into other stocks of questionable value/strategy to make up the perceived ""loss"" (gamblers remorse).

This is where rules about your trading strategy come in.  Such as:

1. Stupid (non-researched Reddit suggestions)  rocket stocks like AMC & GME should take no more than .5% (or other % you decide) total of your portfolio.  All of us have the stupid rocket stocks in their portfolio.  It is how you handle them that counts.
2. All stocks should pay a minimum of 3% (or you choose the %) dividend.
3. All stock purchases should be either at or within 10% (or you choose the %) of 52 week lows.
4. All stocks should not only pay a dividend but grow 10-15% a year (including dividends).  If not sell them and get a better stock.
5. 70% of portfolio should be in long-term good dividend paying stocks (4% or more).
6. Swing trades can take up a total of 25-28% of portfolio.  Swing trade defined as  a trade lasting  three days to 9 months.  Swing trades can also turn into long term holds if they are a consistent performer.  Most, if not all, swing trades should pay a dividend so if I misjudge - still have a dividend to fall back on.
7. Don't read all the dreck in the media about stocks.  Choose 2 to 3 authors that seem to be right more often than not on stock purchases and trends (you have to personally check their records & recommendations, not relying on others to do your work).  All the media outlets have a product to sell - news.  If the news is not exciting, no casual readers are looking at it.   The media finds opinions that are out of the bell curve because that appeals to the panicky nature of people.  Economists who favor a growing economy of 2% are given short shrift.  Now the pseudo-Economist who predicts a 20% annual growth in the economy year after year and stocks always going up is given heavy promotion.  Make wise choices.

The rules are just to get you thinking as to how your ""ideal portfolio"" should perform.  Make up your own rules - don't slavishly follow others stock rules.   Part of this process is assessing your risk tolerance (if you are sick over how your stock purchases go down, you are buying the wrong stocks).  All of this is to get you a process on how to buy stocks more successfully.  I use around 12 rules to filter stocks down to where I am left with viable candidates to do in-depth research on.  I allow myself to buy stocks that meet 9 out of 12 criteria but no less.  Most stocks do not make the cut.

It is never a question of trading too much.  It is a question ""did you make a profit"" (& celebrate that profit even if it is small)?  If you made a profit, case closed, move on to the next buy or stock.  This is not about the size of profit, but more about was it a successful trade & make you money.  I habitually sell too early or too late (near the top but never at the penultimate, just right high point).   Don't care.  I made money, case closed.  Nobody can sell at exactly the high point every time or even most of the time.

41,I agree. But then I can't stop myself from looking back at past tickers for a possible reentry and see them go on monster tears. Having GME at $8 and taking $12 was brutal.

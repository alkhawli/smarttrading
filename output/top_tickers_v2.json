EV\u2019s are currently also only 3% of all car sales, so theres a massive gap they need to fill.

Currently it's $200, Elon has already said FSD price will increase significantly in the future, supposedly this goes for both subscription and full purchases.\n* Estimate the FSD take rate. Currently it's around 10% in the US, where it works best. Obviously this will go up significantly if your car could fully drive itself and earn you money by serving as a robotaxi.\n* Multiply total vehicles on the road by FSD take rate and multiple that by monthly subscription price to get revenue per month.\n* Multiply that by 12 to get FSD revenue per year.\n* Estimate the expected margin percentage. This is a software service, so probably somewhere between 70 and 90%.\n* Multiply yearly FSD revenue by the margin percentage to get the operating income.\n* Multiply that by 0.8 to get a rough estimation of Net Income per year.\n* Estimate what you think Tesla's PE ratio will be by 2030. Lower than 20 is unrealistic, higher than 90 probably is too.\n* Multiply the annual net income by the PE multiple to get Tesla's market cap by 2030.\n\nFinally, put % on the chance you think Tesla has of solving full autonomy this decade, to determine how likely you think that valuation is to come true. Keep in mind this is ONLY from FSD. Car sales, supercharger revenue, energy sales, energy software revenue (autobidder), and any new products/services Tesla is yet to release all still add to their total market cap.\n\nUnless you don't believe Tesla will solve full autonomy this decade - which in my opinion is quite unlikely based on what we know today - I think you'll find that it's probably worth buying some Tesla shares.",

The company is only going to be improving margins and selling greater volumes for the next two years, virtually guaranteed. In my opinion, the step change we are now witnessing in how it\u2019s risks are being evaluated are similar to what happened after it managed to prove manufacturing viability with the Model 3. Tesla has demonstrated successive increased profits, increasing margins, and decreasing income from credits. This is a significant step.

A large number of new car buyers are now saying their next car will be an EV over ICE. This is because longer vehicle lifetime due to lower maintenance. EV\u2019s are currently also only 3% of all car sales, so theres a massive gap they need to fill. Even if you think competition is coming, competition has plans all the way out in 2024, and in low volume. There\u2019s enough room for Tesla to dominate and competition to scale.\n\nA potential tax credit of 7500 is also bonkers and would potentially mean that Tesla wouldn\u2019t have to lower prices for several years.\n\nCybertruck production beginning in 2023 means that Tesla has another massive lever to pull for high ASP vehicle without needing to even lean on a 20k car yet.\n\nFSD doesn\u2019t need to be L5 ready, but it\u2019s definitely improving rapidly.

Even if a price cut was needed, such as 10k, this could very easy triple the total number of customers. Assuming other improvements as mentioned, such as gigapress, 4680, then even with a 10k price cut, they may still be able to maintain 30% or higher margins.\n\nChip shortage is expected to alleviate soon, which should improve margins very nicely.

The past five years for Tesla was literally make-or-break-it and they've made it to a point where EV's are not only sustainable but poised to take advantage of this new green energy movement mass governments have been trying to take charge in. Btw, GM plans to go fully EV by 2035. That means Tesla, at the very least, has many years ahead of them just by the simple fact that GM and other legacy automakers are still trying to figure out how to make EV's profitable without cannibalizing their core business, which atm and for the forseeable future, will be ICE vehicles.\n\nWhether it's overvalued or not, that's a separate discussion. But those who have been doubting TESLA thinking it's just a fad, talking about the regulatory credits and Musk's lunacy are missing out on the fact that Tesla is a legitimate company with some of the best people around the world working on their technology/product(s).",

Develop a base with index funds. Stay away from options for at least 5 years (if ever). Even after introducing individual stocks they should be at most 5-10% of your entire portfolio. Options should be 5% or less. It's tempting when you see people make 100-300% returns in a year (hit it big with one individual stock) or 100-1000% returns in a day (hit it big with an options play), but for every one person that does that there are literally thousands that broke even or lost money. Unless you think a brand new investor is going to outsmart the entire financial system then stay away from the temptation. Fidelity SP500 index, NASDAQ Comp index, total stock market index, etc are your go to indexes until you understand the market better. For example, ever wonder why one month MSFT trades at 260 but the next it's 300 but then the next month it's 285 only to be 305 three weeks later? It doesn't always just correlate with the overall market. What if you bought at the top? These nuances won't matter over longer periods of time but over 1 month to 1 year they could depending on your goals. Stick with an index for now. Lump sum early on then DCA over time - every pay check, once a month, you choose. Same paycheck date, same day of the month, choose one but don't time the market. It won't matter in 2040 if you invested on Monday or next Friday.\n\nAs you learn about your index funds and watch your portfolio hopefully grow over the first couple years it'll buy you time to learn more about individual stocks and TA and other tips or tricks. The same \"opportunities\" in the market right now will still be there in 3-10 years, the opportunities will just be on different tickers. Dumping in a ton of money before you understand what you're doing can result in huge losses and there's definitely no guarantee that the stock will ever recover so you can permanently lose your money in the course of 10 minutes or 10 days.",

No one wants to miss the ride on the way up. You can time it, sure. I think Tesla still has room to fall short-term. But long-term, in 5 years? This stock is going to look super affordable at the price you buy it now.\n\nI've been reading Tesla's 10-K for years now. The numbers and innovations they have planned is on a level that other auto manufacturers are not prepared for.\n\nThink about this fact: GM just publicly came out and stated they wanted to be like TESLA. Imagine a century old company wanting to be like a company that just five years ago, was on the verge of being bankrupt. The past five years for Tesla was literally make-or-break-it and they've made it to a point where EV's are not only sustainable but poised to take advantage of this new green energy movement mass governments have been trying to take charge in. Btw, GM plans to go fully EV by 2035. That means Tesla, at the very least, has many years ahead of them just by the simple fact that GM and other legacy automakers are still trying to figure out how to make EV's profitable without cannibalizing their core business, which atm and for the forseeable future, will be ICE vehicles.\n\nWhether it's overvalued or not, that's a separate discussion. But those who have been doubting TESLA thinking it's just a fad, talking about the regulatory credits and Musk's lunacy are missing out on the fact that Tesla is a legitimate company with some of the best people around the world working on their technology/product(s).",

In regards to the balance sheet --- you want to look for cash on hand / short term cash / receivables and on the liability side you want to understand the companies long term debt. In regards to the income statement --- it is important to understand the companies after tax profit. \n2. Buy companies with staying power. The reason FANG gets a lot of attention is that they have a ton of a long term sustainable growth, fantastic balance sheets and tons of income after tax. (Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, specifically).\n3. Look at quality, individual, names like mentioned in line item two and also put money into the VOO or SPY (which are ETF's that mirror the S&P 500).\n4.

I never invest anymore than I can afford to lose. I buy low (when a stock is down ticking) and I sell high. I used to trade stocks. Now I am an investor. So I buy in, add on down ticks, have an exit strategy. I love three cheap stocks now. You might wanna add them to a watchlist. And make a watchlist of  industry and companies you relate to and love. I own three cheap stocks right now. Two are oil stocks because we\u2019re in a pandemic and oil stocks tanked and are now climbing back. I like Marathon Oil (MRO), it\u2019s about $16.00 a share. I also like (REI) Ring  Energy. It\u2019s only $4.00 a share. I\u2019m also interested in AI and robotics. At just 3 CENTS a share, I bought a huge amount of AITX Artificial  Intelligence Technology Solutions this morning while it was down.  AITX is a penny stock sold on the OTC and risky. I recall reading \u201cinvesting for Idiots\u201d many moons ago. Good luck on this journey!",

If the current trends of growing revenue and margins continue, Tesla will be at Apple's forward PE within 2-3 years. That's not realistic for a company that's growing more than twice as fast while increasing margins. Imagine what happens when they start earnings SAAS revenues with FSD or Autobidder?",

Yes, they are some of the so called meme stocks, but in the time I've been holding them, I've learned a lot about the market.\n\n1. I wouldn't go near the meme stocks right now. I believe they have potential, but I am biased and also nobody knows when and how you'll see returns at that price.\n2. I wouldn't listen and trust blindly to anyone who says this stock will blow up. I could get suggestions and do a DD by myself and then I will make an informed decision.\n3. I personally find ETFs boring, but they are good source of income. Steady income over the years. I have the same sentiment about so called boomer stocks like Apple, Google and so on. They are good investment, but I don't like them.\n4. Always do your DDs. I've always liked ford cars and am nostalgic to NOKIA. They are quite cheap at the moment, so I looked in their business. I saw that FORD will put out electric vehicle (before the new F150 came out) and also they could move in EV direction. NOKIA doesn't only make phones, but they have so many technologies and I think they have potential. Also, Toyota they want to go into Electric car batteries. These three examples are not financial advice, but I want to illustrate that if you like a company, you should look into it. You can check if someone has written a DD on it and check their information, this could save you some time.\n5. Don't be sentimental and as someone said in the comments, take a gain, instead of waiting for a bigger one. When you feel comfortable, cash out and go on the next one",

                    "body": "People will tell you not to listen to YouTube but while almost all \"Buy this stock next!\" videos suck, there are a few people out there who are great at explaining the fundamentals of (long term) investing as opposed to trading (or in other words: gambling). [This guy in particular](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMn36GT_H0X-w5_ckLtlgQ) helped me out a lot, although I must say most of his stock pick videos are 95% clickbait or irrelevant. His whiteboard tutorial videos are amazing to learn to understand the right mindset though. Two examples: [One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jiv7OLAh-I) & [Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0DWyVc6h1k)\n\nAlso, most people will tell you to stick with ETFs, but it depends entirely on what your goal is. If you want to achieve safe and steady growth with minimal effort, ETFs are great. But if you want to learn how to become an actual investor (as opposed to someone who invests) you need to learn how to value and pick individual companies, and your potential gains (and losses) will also be much higher. For example, I've made roughly 154% return on my investments since starting in January 2020 compared to the S&P500's 39%. That would never have been possible had I chosen to just put money in ETFs. That said, I've also underperformed the marked in the last 6 months and it cost me a lot of time to learn the right long term mindset of not worrying about that and research which companies to invest in.\n\nOne last piece of advise is that - especially when you're starting out - it's fine to rely on someone else's research, AS LONG as you truly understand their thesis. Someone can be the best investor in the world, but if you're buying a company just going off their word you're gonna start to doubt if the stock goes down and you'll either sell out when it was a great moment to buy, or you won't recognize when the thesis is not working out and buy while this guy decided to exit the position. Always make sure you truly understand why you're buying into a company, so you can keep track of whether they're executing as the thesis expected.\n\nEDIT: I've also seen some people telling you to focus on macroeconomics (what certain sectors in the market are doing). That's terrible advise. It's extremely difficult to predict what will happen here, not even professional investors get it right 80% of the time. It's all noise for a long term investor. As long as you know how to value a company and project what they will do in the future, anything that has to do with short term price changes (up to 12 months) is irrelevant.\n\nEDIT EDIT: Also, don't touch options until you've been investing for at least two years (or perhaps ever).",

I never invest anymore than I can afford to lose. I buy low (when a stock is down ticking) and I sell high. I used to trade stocks. Now I am an investor. So I buy in, add on down ticks, have an exit strategy. I love three cheap stocks now. You might wanna add them to a watchlist. And make a watchlist of  industry and companies you relate to and love. I own three cheap stocks right now. Two are oil stocks because we\u2019re in a pandemic and oil stocks tanked and are now climbing back. I like Marathon Oil (MRO), it\u2019s about $16.00 a share. I also like (REI) Ring  Energy. It\u2019s only $4.00 a share. I\u2019m also interested in AI and robotics. At just 3 CENTS a share, I bought a huge amount of AITX Artificial  Intelligence Technology Solutions this morning while it was down.  AITX is a penny stock sold on the OTC and risky. I recall reading \u201cinvesting for Idiots\u201d many moons ago. Good luck on this journey!",

                    "body": "I'm young to mid 30s too but several years ahead of you in market knowledge. Short version: Stay away from individual stocks for at least the first 2-3 years. Develop a base with index funds. Stay away from options for at least 5 years (if ever). Even after introducing individual stocks they should be at most 5-10% of your entire portfolio. Options should be 5% or less. It's tempting when you see people make 100-300% returns in a year (hit it big with one individual stock) or 100-1000% returns in a day (hit it big with an options play), but for every one person that does that there are literally thousands that broke even or lost money. Unless you think a brand new investor is going to outsmart the entire financial system then stay away from the temptation. Fidelity SP500 index, NASDAQ Comp index, total stock market index, etc are your go to indexes until you understand the market better. For example, ever wonder why one month MSFT trades at 260 but the next it's 300 but then the next month it's 285 only to be 305 three weeks later? It doesn't always just correlate with the overall market. What if you bought at the top? These nuances won't matter over longer periods of time but over 1 month to 1 year they could depending on your goals. Stick with an index for now. Lump sum early on then DCA over time - every pay check, once a month, you choose. Same paycheck date, same day of the month, choose one but don't time the market. It won't matter in 2040 if you invested on Monday or next Friday.\n\nAs you learn about your index funds and watch your portfolio hopefully grow over the first couple years it'll buy you time to learn more about individual stocks and TA and other tips or tricks. The same \"opportunities\" in the market right now will still be there in 3-10 years, the opportunities will just be on different tickers. Dumping in a ton of money before you understand what you're doing can result in huge losses and there's definitely no guarantee that the stock will ever recover so you can permanently lose your money in the course of 10 minutes or 10 days.",

Nobody can \"teach\" you how to be successful because nobody \"knows\" what's going to happen. \n\nAs far as books, pick which approach you want to take to stocks..day trade(don't recommend until you have experience) shirt, medium, long term investing, or chart analysis..then read a few books on that topic. But don't EVER take someone else's advice on YouTube. Don't even take advice from walstreet bets or anything like that because it's mostly sarcasm and \"pump and dump\" scams.\n\nI can't provide links because I don't trust people with MY money, and I don't take advice because it's usually false advice.",

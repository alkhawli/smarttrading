Seriously low P/E ratio. Alder Lake looks really good, good enough that I doubt AMD's new chips will be much more than competitive. Should have a big dedicated GPU out within the next year that from the leaks sounds seriously efficient - even if the drivers are junk for gaming, miners will love them. GPU designed by Raja Koduri - despite spouting a LOT of BS around the launch of Vega, RDNA was his baby and RDNA was a massive leap forward for AMD, massive jump forward in power and efficiency, and a really lean chip too so cheap to produce. If he can bring some of that magic to Intel that's got me excited.\n\nThe only thing that has me apprehensive about Intel is that for as long as I have known them they have underdelivered and fumbled landings.

VTI is pretty similar, and the worst SPY corrections in the last two decades were like 50%. But thats in the 2008 recession and the dot com bubble. Both of which had really high PE ratios for SPY. 45 for the dot com bubble and over 60 in the 2008 recession. SPY's PE ratio as of late is closer to 30. People will tell you that we are in a bubble, but the amount of earnings don't suggest that.

If I use margin on my brokerage account it allows me to use a certain percentage of my portfolio value depending on the asset (equity, option, loan, etc...). Loan and options are the same percentages, which is half of the stock buying power because they are not as secure as equities and riskier (they can only liquidate so much of a portfolio to recover their losses, they can't come and seize whatever you may have bought with the loan). I'd imagine that a CEO taking a loan against their stock would be similar, that they can take up to a specified percentage of current market value. As the share price or portfolio increases the line of credit or buying power increases as well. There are also margin maintenance requirements, so there has to be a set amount of equity in the portfolio so that the investor doesn't get margin called. As long as there is equity (share price keeps rising or the loan amount isn't at the max percentage), the interest just gets tacked on to the balance of the loan. Someone could obviously opt to pay that interest monthly, and that may be the case with Billionaires (it might even be a tax write-off), but in my experience with margin, it just tacks onto my balance owed.",

Or is it that we now have a lot of bagholders who will get fed up and dip, continuing the downward momentum. Two sides to every story, yada yada. \n\nb) That guidance cut was significant. Sometimes I see guidance reductions that are like a 5% revision downwards and the market freaks the fuck out. This was not one of those cases, over a billion dollar projection cut. Which of course is borne out in the share drop....\n\nc) This market, forward looking as it is right now (which is maybe just code for crazy valuations? Money printer?) seems to be ultra susceptible to any hiccup, Which makes sense when so much growth is priced in on fundamental metrics. And that earnings was no mere hiccup.

Heck Intel could be producing AMD chips pretty soon, especially as China postures to take over Taiwan.  They are spending their entire market cap on fabs, look at Arizona and Europes 'Big honkin fab' and look at how many billions, its quite obvious they are getting huge subsidies.  I think they could get the bulk of the Chips Act that is passing.\n\nIntel also has GPU releasing in a few months, they could be going after Nvidia as well, and they could be working together with AMD to supplant Nvidia.

And I have like 40% of my value in semiconductors. \n\nTell me about it. When I first started investing I thought I was going crazy because everyone was saying that AMD had become overpriced at around $40 per share, but when I was doing the math I was certain that was dirt cheap for the time. I diversified a bit but AMD were still my largest holding. AMD has by far been my best invesment and I wish I listened less to what other people were saying about the company at the time. Like you, I've still been giving my position a regular trim, but I wish AMD would stop making me regret doing it though \ud83d\ude02",

Looking back and overly criticizing, not looking critically but actually  overly criticizing,  your trading strategy is not good for your psyche.  It causes you to plunge deeper into other stocks of questionable value/strategy to make up the perceived \"loss\" (gamblers remorse).\n\nThis is where rules about your trading strategy come in.  Such as:\n\n1. Stupid (non-researched Reddit suggestions)  rocket stocks like AMC & GME should take no more than .5% (or other % you decide) total of your portfolio.  All of us have the stupid rocket stocks in their portfolio.  It is how you handle them that counts.\n2. All stocks should pay a minimum of 3% (or you choose the %) dividend.\n3. All stock purchases should be either at or within 10% (or you choose the %) of 52 week lows.\n4. All stocks should not only pay a dividend but grow 10-15% a year (including dividends).  If not sell them and get a better stock.\n5. 70% of portfolio should be in long-term good dividend paying stocks (4% or more).\n6. Swing trades can take up a total of 25-28% of portfolio.  Swing trade defined as  a trade lasting  three days to 9 months.  Swing trades can also turn into long term holds if they are a consistent performer.  Most, if not all, swing trades should pay a dividend so if I misjudge - still have a dividend to fall back on.\n7. Don't read all the dreck in the media about stocks.  Choose 2 to 3 authors that seem to be right more often than not on stock purchases and trends (you have to personally check their records & recommendations, not relying on others to do your work).  All the media outlets have a product to sell - news.  If the news is not exciting, no casual readers are looking at it.   The media finds opinions that are out of the bell curve because that appeals to the panicky nature of people.  Economists who favor a growing economy of 2% are given short shrift.  Now the pseudo-Economist who predicts a 20% annual growth in the economy year after year and stocks always going up is given heavy promotion.  Make wise choices.\n\nThe rules are just to get you thinking as to how your \"ideal portfolio\" should perform.  Make up your own rules - don't slavishly follow others stock rules.   Part of this process is assessing your risk tolerance (if you are sick over how your stock purchases go down, you are buying the wrong stocks).  All of this is to get you a process on how to buy stocks more successfully.  I use around 12 rules to filter stocks down to where I am left with viable candidates to do in-depth research on.  I allow myself to buy stocks that meet 9 out of 12 criteria but no less.  Most stocks do not make the cut.\n\nIt is never a question of trading too much.  It is a question \"did you make a profit\" (& celebrate that profit even if it is small)?  If you made a profit, case closed, move on to the next buy or stock.  This is not about the size of profit, but more about was it a successful trade & make you money.  I habitually sell too early or too late (near the top but never at the penultimate, just right high point).   Don't care.  I made money, case closed.  Nobody can sell at exactly the high point every time or even most of the time.\n\nEdit: inexcusable grammar mistakes.",

P/E ratio isn\u2019t too far from Disney. Last I checked TSLA was ~380 and DIS was ~270. TSLA used to be magnitudes larger than DIS.\n\n2. Tesla is the undoubted leader in EVs, and everyone is betting on an electrified future. I think something that\u2019s being overlooked is opening the super charger network to other EVs. This will not only generate revenue but also disincentivize other EV companies from creating their own network. I think TSLA will more or less monopolize charging just because it won\u2019t make sense for Rivian or Ford to put chargers where people can already charge faster with Tesla chargers. \n\n\n3. Tesla has a massive head start on software, even if FSD is still a mess. \n\n\n4. Vertical integration. Tesla is mastering vertical integration which translates to huge timeline reductions. While the promises are still usually not based in reality (Elon really should chill a bit) Tesla can get a car to market extremely quickly. If Tesla is able to make batteries I think the stock will skyrocket again. \n\n\n5. Everyone said they\u2019d fail. Literally the entire auto industry thought Tesla was a joke and would fail. I\u2019ve said this before and I\u2019ll say it again, if the entire industry of experts and automotive veterans says Tesla will fail, and then they succeed it makes me wonder why the rest of the industry isn\u2019t trying harder to innovate. Tesla did something the entire industry thought was impossible in 15 years. I can\u2019t even imagine what the next 15 years could hold for Tesla.\n\n\n6. Tesla is also demand limited. Still.

Looking back and overly criticizing, not looking critically but actually  overly criticizing,  your trading strategy is not good for your psyche.  It causes you to plunge deeper into other stocks of questionable value/strategy to make up the perceived \"loss\" (gamblers remorse).\n\nThis is where rules about your trading strategy come in.  Such as:\n\n1. Stupid (non-researched Reddit suggestions)  rocket stocks like AMC & GME should take no more than .5% (or other % you decide) total of your portfolio.  All of us have the stupid rocket stocks in their portfolio.  It is how you handle them that counts.\n2. All stocks should pay a minimum of 3% (or you choose the %) dividend.\n3. All stock purchases should be either at or within 10% (or you choose the %) of 52 week lows.\n4. All stocks should not only pay a dividend but grow 10-15% a year (including dividends).  If not sell them and get a better stock.\n5. 70% of portfolio should be in long-term good dividend paying stocks (4% or more).\n6. Swing trades can take up a total of 25-28% of portfolio.  Swing trade defined as  a trade lasting  three days to 9 months.  Swing trades can also turn into long term holds if they are a consistent performer.  Most, if not all, swing trades should pay a dividend so if I misjudge - still have a dividend to fall back on.\n7. Don't read all the dreck in the media about stocks.  Choose 2 to 3 authors that seem to be right more often than not on stock purchases and trends (you have to personally check their records & recommendations, not relying on others to do your work).  All the media outlets have a product to sell - news.  If the news is not exciting, no casual readers are looking at it.   The media finds opinions that are out of the bell curve because that appeals to the panicky nature of people.  Economists who favor a growing economy of 2% are given short shrift.  Now the pseudo-Economist who predicts a 20% annual growth in the economy year after year and stocks always going up is given heavy promotion.  Make wise choices.\n\nThe rules are just to get you thinking as to how your \"ideal portfolio\" should perform.  Make up your own rules - don't slavishly follow others stock rules.   Part of this process is assessing your risk tolerance (if you are sick over how your stock purchases go down, you are buying the wrong stocks).  All of this is to get you a process on how to buy stocks more successfully.  I use around 12 rules to filter stocks down to where I am left with viable candidates to do in-depth research on.  I allow myself to buy stocks that meet 9 out of 12 criteria but no less.  Most stocks do not make the cut.\n\nIt is never a question of trading too much.  It is a question \"did you make a profit\" (& celebrate that profit even if it is small)?  If you made a profit, case closed, move on to the next buy or stock.  This is not about the size of profit, but more about was it a successful trade & make you money.  I habitually sell too early or too late (near the top but never at the penultimate, just right high point).   Don't care.  I made money, case closed.  Nobody can sell at exactly the high point every time or even most of the time.\n\nEdit: inexcusable grammar mistakes.",

This will not only generate revenue but also disincentivize other EV companies from creating their own network. I think TSLA will more or less monopolize charging just because it won\u2019t make sense for Rivian or Ford to put chargers where people can already charge faster with Tesla chargers. \n\n\n3. Tesla has a massive head start on software, even if FSD is still a mess. \n\n\n4. Vertical integration. Tesla is mastering vertical integration which translates to huge timeline reductions. While the promises are still usually not based in reality (Elon really should chill a bit) Tesla can get a car to market extremely quickly. If Tesla is able to make batteries I think the stock will skyrocket again. \n\n\n5. Everyone said they\u2019d fail. Literally the entire auto industry thought Tesla was a joke and would fail. I\u2019ve said this before and I\u2019ll say it again, if the entire industry of experts and automotive veterans says Tesla will fail, and then they succeed it makes me wonder why the rest of the industry isn\u2019t trying harder to innovate. Tesla did something the entire industry thought was impossible in 15 years. I can\u2019t even imagine what the next 15 years could hold for Tesla.\n\n\n6. Tesla is also demand limited. Still. New Model 3 orders are almost a year out. Their sales aren\u2019t growing because they need to expand production, not because there isn\u2019t demand.",

I like how everybody in TeslaQ land disregards FSD but I watch all the YouTube videos of drivers every update. It can and will come. Sooner than most people think. Especially once they start training the neural net with Dojo in the last half of 2022. FSD take rate will go up. All very high margin revenue. Robotaxis won't be far behind. Other automakers will license FSD or nobody will want their cars. A big reason why other automakers are even making sale is because Tesla is sold out until Aug/Sept next year and people can't wait to get away from ICE vehicles.

The treaty defined aircraft, which Germany was not allowed to have, as being powered by a propeller. As such, the Germans figured they could get around Versailles by making planes not powered by propellers. It wouldn't count as a plane then, and they could have an air force back. So the German government ponied up some resources for R&D. Of course, that research didn't bear fruit until the middle of WW2, but by then they had been ignoring Versailles for a long time. \n\nAlso, the British and Americans both had operational jet fighters shortly after the Germans, as they had been running their own jet research once the war started, but Germany was first, that is still true.

This is due to the nature of options \n1) You need to pick the right strike price to bet on which is where you think the stock will be at or above/below depending on ur position\n2) You need to pick the right direction \n3) You need to pick the right amount of movement in that direction \n4) You need to pick the right date. I\u2019ve seen people buy options that expired one day and then the stock goes up next day and they woulda made 100k if they had bought 1 further day out.\n5) EVEN IF you get all the 4 above right, you\u2019ll learn about IV crush which is where the volatility crashes and everyone basically loses money except theta gang(don\u2019t worry about them for now but they sell the options and it\u2019s a safer play usually)\n\nI also got into investing and burned through couple tens of thousands trying to make it big especially because options lead to greed. It\u2019s not like stocks where u can hold forever, once it\u2019s 4:00pm and market closes ur money is gone whether it be $10 or $100,000,000 it doesn\u2019t matter if you miss your target.\n\nAll that being said, there are lots of videos on YouTube about options, i believe most people recommend tastytrade tutorials. I\u2019ll drop the links below:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HCcF7XbXEWo\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SJWscCeLJrY\n\nI wish you all the best, if I can offer you some parting words to take heed of that I\u2019ve had to learn the hard way so you don\u2019t have to HOPEFULLY lose your money as well.\n\n1) Go into your trades with a plan. If you are looking to make 50% profit sell at 50 and don\u2019t look back because that\u2019s how you get burned.\n2) NEVER EVER EVER REVENGE TRADE. If you made a bad trade, close your app and call it a day and take some days off or weeks depending on your knowledge of yourself, if you keep trading you\u2019ll dig a deeper hole \n3) If anyone mentions a stock here that\u2019s already ran up, it\u2019s best you avoid it or if at all go back to advice 1 and get in and out quickly. Don\u2019t be a bag holder you\u2019ll kick urself.\n4) NO ONE HAS EVER DIED TAKING PROFITS. Sometimes you\u2019ll cut out for $300 profit and the potential profit goes to $3000, you might kick yourself as we all do but just remember, that\u2019s $300 you didn\u2019t have the day before and you made clicking several buttons on your phone. That\u2019s $300 closer to retirement and $300 less physical work or hours you have to clock. Learn to use consistent small gains rather than seeking one time big hits. \n5) FINALLY if you ever make it big enough and hit jackpot, TAKE SOME DAMN MONEY OUT and get into safer stocks like SPY or VTI some proper ETFs and stop risking your entire equity.\n\nBest of luck in you trading career, hope this helps :)\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award\ud83e\udd7a",

This is due to the nature of options \n1) You need to pick the right strike price to bet on which is where you think the stock will be at or above/below depending on ur position\n2) You need to pick the right direction \n3) You need to pick the right amount of movement in that direction \n4) You need to pick the right date. I\u2019ve seen people buy options that expired one day and then the stock goes up next day and they woulda made 100k if they had bought 1 further day out.\n5) EVEN IF you get all the 4 above right, you\u2019ll learn about IV crush which is where the volatility crashes and everyone basically loses money except theta gang(don\u2019t worry about them for now but they sell the options and it\u2019s a safer play usually)\n\nI also got into investing and burned through couple tens of thousands trying to make it big especially because options lead to greed. It\u2019s not like stocks where u can hold forever, once it\u2019s 4:00pm and market closes ur money is gone whether it be $10 or $100,000,000 it doesn\u2019t matter if you miss your target.\n\nAll that being said, there are lots of videos on YouTube about options, i believe most people recommend tastytrade tutorials. I\u2019ll drop the links below:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HCcF7XbXEWo\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SJWscCeLJrY\n\nI wish you all the best, if I can offer you some parting words to take heed of that I\u2019ve had to learn the hard way so you don\u2019t have to HOPEFULLY lose your money as well.\n\n1) Go into your trades with a plan. If you are looking to make 50% profit sell at 50 and don\u2019t look back because that\u2019s how you get burned.\n2) NEVER EVER EVER REVENGE TRADE. If you made a bad trade, close your app and call it a day and take some days off or weeks depending on your knowledge of yourself, if you keep trading you\u2019ll dig a deeper hole \n3) If anyone mentions a stock here that\u2019s already ran up, it\u2019s best you avoid it or if at all go back to advice 1 and get in and out quickly. Don\u2019t be a bag holder you\u2019ll kick urself.\n4) NO ONE HAS EVER DIED TAKING PROFITS. Sometimes you\u2019ll cut out for $300 profit and the potential profit goes to $3000, you might kick yourself as we all do but just remember, that\u2019s $300 you didn\u2019t have the day before and you made clicking several buttons on your phone. That\u2019s $300 closer to retirement and $300 less physical work or hours you have to clock. Learn to use consistent small gains rather than seeking one time big hits. \n5) FINALLY if you ever make it big enough and hit jackpot, TAKE SOME DAMN MONEY OUT and get into safer stocks like SPY or VTI some proper ETFs and stop risking your entire equity.\n\nBest of luck in you trading career, hope this helps :)\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award\ud83e\udd7a",

The British government never saw much application for it back in the early 1930s. The idea more or less got shelved. \n\nIn Germany however, aviation engineers had a lot more interest in alternative propulsion for aircraft because of the treaty of Versailles. The treaty defined aircraft, which Germany was not allowed to have, as being powered by a propeller. As such, the Germans figured they could get around Versailles by making planes not powered by propellers. It wouldn't count as a plane then, and they could have an air force back. So the German government ponied up some resources for R&D. Of course, that research didn't bear fruit until the middle of WW2, but by then they had been ignoring Versailles for a long time. \n\nAlso, the British and Americans both had operational jet fighters shortly after the Germans, as they had been running their own jet research once the war started, but Germany was first, that is still true. The British Meteors even saw a little combat iirc they were used to knock down V1 rockets because they were fast enough to catch them.",

P/E ratio isn\u2019t too far from Disney. Last I checked TSLA was ~380 and DIS was ~270. TSLA used to be magnitudes larger than DIS.\n\n2. Tesla is the undoubted leader in EVs, and everyone is betting on an electrified future. I think something that\u2019s being overlooked is opening the super charger network to other EVs. This will not only generate revenue but also disincentivize other EV companies from creating their own network. I think TSLA will more or less monopolize charging just because it won\u2019t make sense for Rivian or Ford to put chargers where people can already charge faster with Tesla chargers. \n\n\n3. Tesla has a massive head start on software, even if FSD is still a mess. \n\n\n4. Vertical integration. Tesla is mastering vertical integration which translates to huge timeline reductions. While the promises are still usually not based in reality (Elon really should chill a bit) Tesla can get a car to market extremely quickly. If Tesla is able to make batteries I think the stock will skyrocket again. \n\n\n5. Everyone said they\u2019d fail. Literally the entire auto industry thought Tesla was a joke and would fail. I\u2019ve said this before and I\u2019ll say it again, if the entire industry of experts and automotive veterans says Tesla will fail, and then they succeed it makes me wonder why the rest of the industry isn\u2019t trying harder to innovate. Tesla did something the entire industry thought was impossible in 15 years. I can\u2019t even imagine what the next 15 years could hold for Tesla.\n\n\n6. Tesla is also demand limited. Still. New Model 3 orders are almost a year out. Their sales aren\u2019t growing because they need to expand production, not because there isn\u2019t demand.",

Billionaire owner (so will never go bankrupt), seeing complete remissions in some refractory, hard to treat cancers, as well as incredible trial results; NIH just added Anktiva to Keytruda for refractory NSCLC trial at 700 sites; waiting for BLA submission (72% CR) for refractory NMIBC. IBRX is actually ahead of the natural killer cell pack. Developed a \u201c2nd gen\u201d COVID vaccine last year that was (criminally) not funded, so IBRX is trialing it in South Africa. Lots of catalysts AND he has the experience of taking drugs from clinical development to approval in the past.\nEdit to add great rundown found here:\n\nhttps://www.shovel-stocks.com/post/immunitybio-ibrx-update-major-disconnect-between-value-price\n\n\nThis is my 10x bet.",

Their valuation right now is astronomical compared to their current revenue. That looks scary. You have to wonder why? They are edging in on the cloud services market that amazon dominates (113b in q2 2021). Google (4.9 q3 2021) and microsoft (?) are doing billions in revenue on their clouds as well. So we are talking in three big players around half a trillion in revenue in the space. Cloudflare is valued at 61b right now. If it really succeeds in taking market share away from AWS and creating a new market for things AWS doesn't do and from people who don't use AWS, it has the potential to be massive. Their engineering is world class and they are pushing hard at new stuff. They are large enough to shape how others engineer products too. If companies partner, and their tech really locks in, their potential is astronomical.",

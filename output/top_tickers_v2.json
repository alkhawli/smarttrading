Starting from the 1948 US political and financial masterminds created the system that was unimaginable and unseen before. Questioning gold as an ultimate reserve and replacing it with something that only one country can produce. Infinitely. Combined with skillful management, building friendly ties with other states and many more allowed US today to influence the world economy to the degree that it can't fail without a major consequences for all of the globe. No country today can question dollar as a reserve currency, no country today can sell a significant amount of dollar debt, no country is able to shake the influence of US corporations. Because all those actions will result in near-war state and a huge financial instability.\r  \n\r  \nThe system that was created affect every singe person in the world and after Soviet Union collapse there is no other viable counter system. This total dominance is what people mean when saying \"Don't Bet Against America\".\r  \n\r  \nDoes this also mean \"Stocks only go up\"? Of course not. This system as any other one is absolutely not ideal and will collapse at some point, but keep in mind that when this happens whole world will go either into a greatest recession or WW3. That's why most governments rely on the US and will try to keep dollar-system afloat no matter what.\r  \n\r  \nAnd Japan is well... Japan. One of the other 194 countries of the world.",

In hindsight it led to an insanely favorable environment for me to be buying stocks over the next ten plus years.\n\n-Start by buying ETFs (VTI, VOO, VUG, QQQ, etc) and pick up stocks along the way if you hear of something reasonable.

Don\u2019t sit around and wait.\n\n-Don\u2019t freak out during a correction and sell, assuming you have enough cash to keep you going for a few months.

A call option on the bought company will have value if the buyout price is above the option exercise or strike price. As a example, you hold an option to buy at $40 per share and the underlying stock is bought out for $50 cash. On the date the buyout is effective, you would receive $1,000 for your option: the $50 buyout price minus the $40 option strike price, times the 100 shares that one option contract covers. If the strike price on your call was above the $50, you would get nothing. Put option holders would receive cash if the buyout price were below the put strike price. A trader who sold options would be required to deliver the cash.\n\n\n\nAll-Stock Offer\nWith an all-stock merger, the number of shares covered by a call option is changed to adjust for the value of the buyout. The options on the bought-out company will change to options on the buyer stock at the same strike price, but for a different number of shares. Normally, one option is for 100 shares of the underlying stock. For example, company A buys company B, exchanging 1/2 share of A for each share of B. Options purchased on company B stock would change to options on company A, with 50 shares of stock delivered if the option is exercised.",

I think learning on your own is a much better tack to take.  You gonna be doing this for decades so the best time to learn is now.  There are huge amounts of resources online to learn what's going on.  And you'll never know all of it unless you actually work in the industry...  I've been doing it for 20+ years and still learn new things all the time.  \n2. Most brokerages offer no fees on stock trades these days -- it's fine to do it through your bank, or pick a brokerage, or whatever.  If you're doing it yourself and not using an advisor, it doesn't matter all that much which you choose as long as there aren't fees.  I use Schwab which has actual brick and mortar locations, but I haven't actually been inside one in close to 10 years.  Opening an account is no more complicated than opening a bank account.\n3. A brokerage account is like a bank account with extra options (to do things with your money like buy stock), so no real limitations and no tax benefits.  IRAs are retirement accounts with tax benefits, but also restrictions about how much you can put in, when you can take money out, etc.  They come in two flavors -- Roth and Traditional.  The differences are important but you'll probably want to read about them specifically.  401ks are like IRAs, but they're done through your employer, generally subtracted right from your paycheck.  They also come in those two flavors -- Roth and traditional.  Many employers will do things like matching -- for instance, my employer will match any money I put into my 401k up to 4%, so I make 4% more simply by electing to shove 4% of each paycheck into the 401k.  The caveat being that I don't see that money until retirement, of course... But hey, it's still free money.  \n4. Money you don't need.  Traditional advice is you should have a rainy day fund for unexpected car repairs, etc.  Usually 3-12 months depending on who you ask and how conservative they are.  Then after that, shove all excess money into things like your employer's 401k, your IRAs, your brokerage account.  \n\nOrder and amount will differ depending on your situation.  Usually the order is something like: \n\n1. Enough into 401k to get any company matching (free money!)\n2. Max out Roth IRA for the tax benefits, plus the money you contribute is easily accessible in an emergency (earnings not)\n3. Enough to max out 401k\n4. Brokerage\n\nBut your situation may be different.  For instance, I swapped #3 and #4 quite a while as I was saving for a down payment for a house.\n\nIn terms of picking what to invest in:\n\n1. I'd probably start with just shoving it into an index fund of some sort -- VOO tracks the S&P 500, or VTI includes all American stocks.  There's huge overlap between those, as the S&P 500 is 500 of the largest US companies, so VTI is like 87% of the money into VOO, and the remaining 13% into smaller US companies.  \n\n2. You can stop there, and you'll do better than a hell of a lot of investors.\n\n3. If you want to try and beat that or change your risk profile, the next logical place would be narrower funds or funds with exposure to things you don't already have exposure to.  Like VT invests in ALL companies, including overseas.  or VFH is specifically financial sector stocks, or VGT is tech sector stocks, or BND is a bond fund, etc.  (I'm just using vanguard funds because they're generally good -- others are also good)\n\n4. You can try to pick specific companies, like if you're a believer in Apple, you can just directly buy AAPL stock.  But you'll already have exposure to it in those other funds you're already invested in, so you can kind of think of it as just weighting your portfolio more heavily in one direction than another.",

Even with the conservative guidance I'd venture a bet that in 12 months NFLX will outperform DIS stock.  They're now at a scale making production costs relatively low and not afraid to make 'risky' swings... pretty sure you'll never find something like Squidgames on Disney. \n\nSo yeah, I'm bullish NFLX.",

That's not what TA is used for if you're using it correctly... what it should be used for is to establish degrees of confidence in a position based on the number of overall factors working in your favor, such as the direction of a trend. If a trend is move up and it's strong and you're buying puts, you're betting against the direction of the market, which is fine if you have a good reason for doing so. OP's reasoning was also due to TA... they looked at the history of SPY and deduced that SPY doesn't normally have more than X number of green days in a row, and that's generally true, but if you look at times when SPY is coming out of a longer downward trend, it \\*can\\* run for more than 5 days in the green. \n\nMy point is just that if we're looking at the factors on the bet, there's more working against it than there is for it directionally.

I think learning on your own is a much better tack to take.  You gonna be doing this for decades so the best time to learn is now.  There are huge amounts of resources online to learn what's going on.  And you'll never know all of it unless you actually work in the industry...  I've been doing it for 20+ years and still learn new things all the time.  \n2. Most brokerages offer no fees on stock trades these days -- it's fine to do it through your bank, or pick a brokerage, or whatever.  If you're doing it yourself and not using an advisor, it doesn't matter all that much which you choose as long as there aren't fees.  I use Schwab which has actual brick and mortar locations, but I haven't actually been inside one in close to 10 years.  Opening an account is no more complicated than opening a bank account.\n3. A brokerage account is like a bank account with extra options (to do things with your money like buy stock), so no real limitations and no tax benefits.  IRAs are retirement accounts with tax benefits, but also restrictions about how much you can put in, when you can take money out, etc.  They come in two flavors -- Roth and Traditional.  The differences are important but you'll probably want to read about them specifically.  401ks are like IRAs, but they're done through your employer, generally subtracted right from your paycheck.  They also come in those two flavors -- Roth and traditional.  Many employers will do things like matching -- for instance, my employer will match any money I put into my 401k up to 4%, so I make 4% more simply by electing to shove 4% of each paycheck into the 401k.  The caveat being that I don't see that money until retirement, of course... But hey, it's still free money.  \n4. Money you don't need.  Traditional advice is you should have a rainy day fund for unexpected car repairs, etc.  Usually 3-12 months depending on who you ask and how conservative they are.  Then after that, shove all excess money into things like your employer's 401k, your IRAs, your brokerage account.  \n\nOrder and amount will differ depending on your situation.  Usually the order is something like: \n\n1. Enough into 401k to get any company matching (free money!)\n2. Max out Roth IRA for the tax benefits, plus the money you contribute is easily accessible in an emergency (earnings not)\n3. Enough to max out 401k\n4. Brokerage\n\nBut your situation may be different.  For instance, I swapped #3 and #4 quite a while as I was saving for a down payment for a house.\n\nIn terms of picking what to invest in:\n\n1. I'd probably start with just shoving it into an index fund of some sort -- VOO tracks the S&P 500, or VTI includes all American stocks.  There's huge overlap between those, as the S&P 500 is 500 of the largest US companies, so VTI is like 87% of the money into VOO, and the remaining 13% into smaller US companies.  \n\n2. You can stop there, and you'll do better than a hell of a lot of investors.\n\n3. If you want to try and beat that or change your risk profile, the next logical place would be narrower funds or funds with exposure to things you don't already have exposure to.  Like VT invests in ALL companies, including overseas.  or VFH is specifically financial sector stocks, or VGT is tech sector stocks, or BND is a bond fund, etc.  (I'm just using vanguard funds because they're generally good -- others are also good)\n\n4. You can try to pick specific companies, like if you're a believer in Apple, you can just directly buy AAPL stock.  But you'll already have exposure to it in those other funds you're already invested in, so you can kind of think of it as just weighting your portfolio more heavily in one direction than another.",

I think learning on your own is a much better tack to take.  You gonna be doing this for decades so the best time to learn is now.  There are huge amounts of resources online to learn what's going on.  And you'll never know all of it unless you actually work in the industry...  I've been doing it for 20+ years and still learn new things all the time.  \n2. Most brokerages offer no fees on stock trades these days -- it's fine to do it through your bank, or pick a brokerage, or whatever.  If you're doing it yourself and not using an advisor, it doesn't matter all that much which you choose as long as there aren't fees.  I use Schwab which has actual brick and mortar locations, but I haven't actually been inside one in close to 10 years.  Opening an account is no more complicated than opening a bank account.\n3. A brokerage account is like a bank account with extra options (to do things with your money like buy stock), so no real limitations and no tax benefits.  IRAs are retirement accounts with tax benefits, but also restrictions about how much you can put in, when you can take money out, etc.  They come in two flavors -- Roth and Traditional.  The differences are important but you'll probably want to read about them specifically.  401ks are like IRAs, but they're done through your employer, generally subtracted right from your paycheck.  They also come in those two flavors -- Roth and traditional.  Many employers will do things like matching -- for instance, my employer will match any money I put into my 401k up to 4%, so I make 4% more simply by electing to shove 4% of each paycheck into the 401k.  The caveat being that I don't see that money until retirement, of course... But hey, it's still free money.  \n4. Money you don't need.  Traditional advice is you should have a rainy day fund for unexpected car repairs, etc.  Usually 3-12 months depending on who you ask and how conservative they are.  Then after that, shove all excess money into things like your employer's 401k, your IRAs, your brokerage account.  \n\nOrder and amount will differ depending on your situation.  Usually the order is something like: \n\n1. Enough into 401k to get any company matching (free money!)\n2. Max out Roth IRA for the tax benefits, plus the money you contribute is easily accessible in an emergency (earnings not)\n3. Enough to max out 401k\n4. Brokerage\n\nBut your situation may be different.  For instance, I swapped #3 and #4 quite a while as I was saving for a down payment for a house.\n\nIn terms of picking what to invest in:\n\n1. I'd probably start with just shoving it into an index fund of some sort -- VOO tracks the S&P 500, or VTI includes all American stocks.  There's huge overlap between those, as the S&P 500 is 500 of the largest US companies, so VTI is like 87% of the money into VOO, and the remaining 13% into smaller US companies.  \n\n2. You can stop there, and you'll do better than a hell of a lot of investors.\n\n3. If you want to try and beat that or change your risk profile, the next logical place would be narrower funds or funds with exposure to things you don't already have exposure to.  Like VT invests in ALL companies, including overseas.  or VFH is specifically financial sector stocks, or VGT is tech sector stocks, or BND is a bond fund, etc.  (I'm just using vanguard funds because they're generally good -- others are also good)\n\n4. You can try to pick specific companies, like if you're a believer in Apple, you can just directly buy AAPL stock.  But you'll already have exposure to it in those other funds you're already invested in, so you can kind of think of it as just weighting your portfolio more heavily in one direction than another.",

If you\u2019re doing a Roth IRA what I did was size my investments to thematics to a smaller percentage of my portfolio. The idea is simply to give yourself exposure. I personally invested in ICLN $1000 on a 14k account for clean energy exposure. I believe clean energy and products that clean the environment are going to replace traditional power sources. We are still early investors at this stage in clean energy which is the beautiful thing. Clean energy is also finally reaching some maturity levels technologically that make if feasible for mass deployment. As the cost of other energy continues to rise clean energy becomes more attractive. This is a hold til I retire stock, though. \n\nIf I was in your shoes making the decision with my money I\u2019d take a similarly balanced approach. I would not sell these ETFs though. I\u2019d keep holding them and let them compound. I\u2019d put most of my investment into a broad market index fund, and a chunk into a world market index fund, then I\u2019d use maybe 7-8% on thematics for more focused exposure. If I was picking from the above, cloud and clean energy. I personally believe EV is a bubble. Health is risky mainly because we don\u2019t know if health care will eventually be nationalized in our lifetimes and that could be terrible for for profit businesses. \n\nOn a side note, if you can use options in your Roth and you plan to buy the index anyways if there\u2019s an options tree you\u2019ll could also sell in the money puts depending on how many shares you want to own to collect a little premium to start your long term investing career and lower your initial cost basis. \n\nFor others reading this comment my Roth account size for wife and I is 28k, 401k is 143k and brokerage account is 130k with 62k in the bank.

That's not what TA is used for if you're using it correctly... what it should be used for is to establish degrees of confidence in a position based on the number of overall factors working in your favor, such as the direction of a trend. If a trend is move up and it's strong and you're buying puts, you're betting against the direction of the market, which is fine if you have a good reason for doing so. OP's reasoning was also due to TA... they looked at the history of SPY and deduced that SPY doesn't normally have more than X number of green days in a row, and that's generally true, but if you look at times when SPY is coming out of a longer downward trend, it \\*can\\* run for more than 5 days in the green. \n\nMy point is just that if we're looking at the factors on the bet, there's more working against it than there is for it directionally. That just means it's a probabilistically longer shot. \n\nThe market itself is definitely chaotic, but it does have tendencies and there are underlying factors that impact aggregate behavior under certain conditions... sometimes just having a lot of upward momentum is enough to perpetuate a run.",

                    "body": "Things that I learned the hard way: \n\n1. Time in the market is much better than trying to time the market. If you wait forever for a dip that might never come, you might very well lose out on a bunch of gains before you finally decided to buy in at a higher price anyway.\n\n2. Don't panic sell. It is very hard to resist the urge once you see your stock in free fall but more often than not, that free fall is followed by some green days sooner rather than later. Invest in companies which you really stand behind and which you trust will never suddenly go bankrupt. Then chill, zoom out on the chart. You should have an investment horizon of 10+ years. That way you will always come out with a profit. Statistically, some of the best performing portfolios are the ones, who's owners are dead. -> not making any rash stupid decisions.\nMy friend at Goldman told me if you trade back and forth and coincidentally miss 1-2 of the best performing days in a year, your investment in a stock is often pretty much f$\u00a3\u00a5ed. If you just hold and chill, you will be sure not to miss them and they will usually outweigh any losses you make in-between.\nThe market is unpredictable. Some highly skilled Wallstreet analysts will always be smarter than you and take your hard earned cash if you try to time the market better than them. \n\n3. Dollar cost average. If you plan on investing a large amount, it's risky to go in all at once. If you spread it out evenly for some days, weeks, years, the probability of buying in at a very bad time sinks.\n\n4. I know this goes against what I said about timing the market but in a szenario where you think the whole economy might crash at any moment, keep some cash ready to buy the dip. If you see a dip between 20 and 40% on many or most stocks, buy that dip. Recovery might not be fast but it will happen.\n\n5. Never short. \"The market can stay irrational for longer than you can stay solvent.\" You might be 1000% right that a stock is grossly overvalued. You will just not be able to predict how high it will still rise before it crashes and that will likely break your neck. Options trading is a casino. It is fine if you like casinos and play but always be aware that this is what you are doing. Never make some fast gains by coincidence and start to think wow... I am really good at this. That will be your downfall.\n\nEdit1: spelling\n\nEdit2: \n\nlet me just quickly clarify where I am coming from, concerning dollar cost averaging and timing the market.\n\nDCA: I am currently in the situation where I want to put a lot of money into MSCI world ETFs. If you take a look at the historic chart, everyone with a brain might say that the development of the last 10 years will not go on forever. These discussions have been going on for years, I will not repeat them. I don't want to be the idiot who pushes all his life savings into the stock market right before a crisis so for me dca is a very good solution imo. Of course I did not mean ALWAYS dca. That doesn't make sense - you are correct in criticizing.\n\nTiming: Again, I don't mean never try to time the market. I also try to buy a dip here and there but I stopped thinking I could predict the future. I only use my small \"messing around\" account to buy options which are the pinnacle of trying to time the market. What I am trying to say is: Most of the people who install a broker app and let the marketing trick them into thinking they are professional daytraders all of a sudden are idiots.",

Even if you think you can find the magical percentage, you'll just get burned.\n\nI bought MRNA super low back in March of 2020, something like the $20s or $30s IIRC. By March of 2021 I had past the year holding and wanted to cash out, as I dont typically like holding pharma stocks. \n\nThe stock had peaked at $180 in February before dropping to $140. I figured the market would rebound and it would start trending back up, which it did. I implemented my first and only stop loss. I wanted to be generous to make sure it didnt get triggered prematurely. I figured 15% would be big enough to catch any impending big crash, but not trigger based on daily volitility.\n\nIt triggered two days later on just a regular ass wednesday, nothing volitile really going on. Sold around $150.\n\nNot complaining cause I still made out with +600% or something, but just a few months later MRNA peaked at over $400. \n\nTaught me two valuable lessons.\n\n1.  A stop loss is more likely to trigger on a bad day than save you from a market collapse, and it never feels good to sell low just to watch the price rebound hours later.\n\n 2. Don't watch your stocks after you sell. \n\nJust wait for a peak, sell, and walk away.",

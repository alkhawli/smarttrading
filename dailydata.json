And legacy auto has no means to produce a comparable autonomy stack.\n\nI would also argue that legacy does not have the ability to scale battery production and their cars are inefficient so they need more batteries to achieve the same range.  Tesla is only EV that can use lithium iron phosphate cells in a full size car and get a usable range.  The iron based chemistry is much more widely available and a lower cost per unit. \n\nThere are many other more obscure reasons why Tesla cannot be matched by legacy autos. \n\nBecause the lead time for production of autos is much longer than phones it is the same kind of disruption, possibly more dramatic, but played out over 15 years instead of 2-3 years."

I haven't been able to find any (I just assume this is because the mathematics involved are simple enough to cast into the metal gears of mechanical computing devices used at race tracks around the world starting in the late 1800s).

Therefore they should almost double their revenue in the first quarter of next year from the current 412.5 million in 2nd quarter to estimated 700+ millions each quarter of next year.\n\nThey got a rating upgrade to 3.5 stars. With 3.5 stars rating, the medicare program will give them 15% more in rebate payment. That 15% increase in rebate payment from medicare is huge boost to their revenue.\n\nThey have developer APIs on their website while other competitors don't have and these apis could make them money later. These APIs can be used easily to integrate with other third party apps. \n\nCEO said once that we are going to expand into other lines of business in the future. So, it means they are going to expand to employee and individual & family health insurance plans.\n\nStock has hit bottom and is bouncing off the bottom. Over 31 millions of shares shorted.

Thanks to the fashion industry, mainstream media, and social media, people are embracing obesity and normalizing it by telling you it is ok to be fat. The U.S. Government alone spends millions of taxpayers dollars every year treating people with diabetes.\n\nSENS is a small company from Germantown, Maryland, that is highly undervalued. The company is focused on the development and commercialization of a long-term, implantable continuous glucose monitoring, or CGM, system to improve the lives of people with diabetes by enhancing their ability to manage their disease with relative ease and accuracy. Their Eversense and Eversense XL CGM systems are designed to continually and accurately measure glucose levels in people with diabetes via an under-the-skin sensor, a removable and rechargeable smart transmitter, and a convenient app for real-time diabetes monitoring and management for a period of up to 90 and 180 days, respectively, as compared to seven to 14 days for non-implantable CGM systems. SENS 90 days CGM was approved by the FDA. SENS is currently awaiting on FDA approval for the 180 days CGM, which has already been approved for use in Europe. FDA approval is very likely to send this stock sky-high. As of yesterday, the short interest borrow rate is @6%."

The presence of a deity or deities is not necessary for a religion to receive protection under Title VII.  Religious beliefs can include unique beliefs held by a few or even one individual; however, mere personal preferences are not religious beliefs.  Individuals who do not practice any religion are also protected from discrimination on the basis of religion or lack thereof.  Title VII requires employers to accommodate religious beliefs, practices and observances if the beliefs are \u201csincerely held\u201d and the reasonable accommodation poses no undue hardship on the employer.\u201d\n\nEdit: I\u2019d like to add, normally what an employee claims a religious exemption that\u2019s the end of the conversation. This process of the employer deciding what does or does not constitute a religious exemption will open them up to tons of title VII lawsuits."

That\u2019s been the whole goal of this printing. \n\nNow you can probably foresee the problem. What happens when VOM returns to normal? Then you get a massive spike in GDP, and that would be the inflation that we\u2019re currently seeing. Because GDP is increasing in dollars, not in terms of actual production. \n\nNormally the government would sell bonds to reduce the MS to take care of this problem, but the FED is actually BUYING bonds, this further compounding the problem. It\u2019s like adding lighter fluid to a fire trying to put it out. \n\nSo this is the 2 minute explanation I can provide as someone with a degree in economics."

This was completely understandable due to the supply constraints and disruption we have faced.\n\nHowever, now is appears to be spreading into most areas of the CPI - Housing, Food, Core goods and services, and perhaps most troublingly, it is now setting into the labour market. Once it gets settled into labour it really becomes a problem, because the only way out involves hurting people.\n\nThe situation in the 70s was actually very similar - it started with supply side shocks, monetary policy eased, the supply shocks eased, but by then the inflation had become endemic. What is really important about inflation is not so much the absolute rate of inflation, or how long it persists, but what people *expect* to happen. Once people believe it is happening, it will. People will unload money faster. Businesses will put prices up. Bosses will grant pay rises to their employees, landlords will put rents up, and it starts a cycle which cannot be stopped without very firm, even brutal, action.\n\nIt is still possible inflation falls back to target of it's own accord, and people continue to believe it is transient. But, we're on the edge of a precipice now, and the Fed should be watching the data extremely carefully and be ready to act if it continues to become broad-based, expected inflation."

Instead, they got a boom in demand a month later, but semiconductor companies can't turn on a dime and fulfill orders like that, and 3) the price of lumber for similar reasons. Lumber mills shut down during Covid, anticipating a steep decline in demand. Instead, many people who thought Covid would be bad for years (remember this was before vaccines were developed and everyone thought it would be years before we'd get a grip on it) began moving out of densely populated urban areas and into suburbs. Housing demand skyrocketed and building supplies were limited. I guess the Fed buying mortgage backed securities didn't help either, but that effect was probably minimal.\n\nI could go on, but bottom line, smaller businesses trying to make up for lost revenue and raising prices to help pay for higher wages given the labor shortage, and larger businesses that completely misjudged the economic effects of Covid.\n\nHow long will it last? Who knows? I think it's going to be with us a while, another year or so at least. Supply chain issues and labor shortages are real problems that aren't going to be a quick fix. Also, as long as doom and gloom headlines exist, small businesses are going to scared to death of another shut-down and keep prices high. There's also something to be said about higher demand for services. Everyone wants to get out. We're all sick of being stuck at home. That will continue next spring and summer too."

The fed has the power to increase or decrease the reserve requirement to get banks to lend less or more. The problem is since 2008, the banks have been holding so many excess reserves the FED dosnt even need a reserve requirement anymore, there are many theories for this however I belive that because the fed started paying intrest on excess reserves the banks are less willing to lend. But the real reason for the declining velocity of money is the private sectors decision to hoard those excess reserves as deposits at the fed have lead to the decades long trend of decline in the velocity of money.

Not only are they mandated to do it, but they know the consequences of not acting. It has been seen countless times before and the outcomes are predictable. And every opportunity you have to address it is worse than the last one you turned down.\n\nJerome Powell has mostly seen the risk to be on the deflationary side so far - that we won't get enough inflation, and will fall into a deflationary scenario with rates and zero and unlimited QE. That would also be a major problem for them. But regardless of what he personally thinks, the fact is he is obligated to target 2% inflation, and will have armies of analysts, some of the finest minds in the country, laying reports on his desk every day flagging the growing inflation risk. There is no ignoring this. Anyone who thinks we'll just have high inflation and zero rates is kidding themselves.\n\nAnd to anyone who wrongly believes high inflation = asset price gains, it doesn't, because the spectre of rate rises will always be overhead (falling rates = asset price gains, as seen over the past 18 months). Stocks lost over 50% of their value in *real* terms in the 70s. Real Estate held level in real terms, but people were paying obscene sums of interest on their mortgages, factor that in, and they lost a lot of money. There are no winners in inflation, and nobody will like it if it happens."

If it doesn't, then you've just made an excellent move and mitigated the need for more drastic action later"

Yet there is an important qualifier in the case of debit cards, and that is you must notify the bank within two days of the loss or theft. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) notes in the case of debit cards, \"if you notify your bank after those first two days, under the law you could lose much more.\" \n\n>In the case of debit cards, if the problem isn't reported within those two days you could be liable for up to $500 in fraudulent charges. There is even the potential to be on the hook for more than $500 depending on the circumstances and the situation. \n\nWhen you use a debit card, you are responsible for fraud on the account. When you use a credit card, the bank is responsible for the fraud.\n\n>In situations like the most recent Target example, an individual has 60 days to report an unauthorized transaction with a debit card if the number is stolen and the card is not. This is all contingent on carefully reviewing every transaction to ensure that all purchases were indeed made by the cardholder. In the case of a credit card, there is no 60 day limit to the error -- instead, you are simply \"not liable for unauthorized use,\" according to the Federal Trade Commission."

But, their internal models are telling them that a 10 to 20 percent correction is imminent.\n\nNow, I'm guessing, after you read this comment, you'll probably think of something negative to say about Morgan Stanley, but the funny thing is, I bet if their prediction was that a new even more bullish rally was imminent, you'd probably be perfectly fine with that.\n\nBoth of them are predictions. \"Stocks will go on a tremendous rally to close out 2021\", \"Stocks are headed for a major correction at the end of 2021\".\n\nBoth are predictions. Why does one prediction cause so much agitation, while the other prediction is celebrated?"

Monetary policy that created those trends isn't going away. Equity risk premium is something to consider that people adhering strictly to Schiller PE model don't address.\n\nAnd there are plenty of truly undervalued companies out there if that's your jam (SMG, leading bank stocks like JPM as rates edge back up, energy companies like VLO that are priced below where they were pre-covid and far below similar secular trends in energy markets, AAWW, ZIM). Or buy up strong REITs. REITs have outperformed SP500 once dividends reinvested over the past few decades. VICI has 100 percent rent collection and is extremely well managed.\n\nAll of which is to say, I used to be just like you. It's a dangerous game IMO. I think averaging in to the entire stock market at your age is the way to go. Keep lots of cash on hand to buy more as needed.

Companies that generate strong free cash flows and are perennially important are where to put your cash IMO.\n\nJurien Timmer of Fidelity is an analyst to pay attention to.

Just that you have missed the \\~100% upside.\n\nImo it makes no sense to have a specific cash position for any time in the market; what is much more important is the ratio of your total portfolio size relative to your monthly cashflows. If you are earning so much (or your portfolio is so little) that you earn the total portfolio size within a year for example, it makes no sense to have a high cash position because a true bear market takes on average 12-18 months, so its enough time for you to get cash the following months and deploy directly or start building a cash position during the downtime. If a 1-week downside of -15% or so happens well then you may deploy all the cash you have left at that moment (I personally prefer 5-15% cash at all times but its not set in stone). In case such a crash turns out to be a longer-lived bear market you again have your earnings the next months to deploy.\n\nIf your portfolio is of bigger size/your monthly cashflows are small well then its a different story and you could think about more like 20% cash and a plan to deploy in case of a crash/bear market i.e. dont put in everything at the first -10%. But everything above 20% cash makes no sense from a probabilistic point of view because markets tend to go up most of the time so trying to \"time\" that small window of opportunity when markets indeed go -70% and more (which happens once in a lifetime) I would say is very risky. Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent; in other words: dont try to time what only happens once in a lifetime even though everything looks like it is happening at any moment. Because there are people that have said that since 2010. Dont be that guy. If you happen to be 90% in the market when this once in a lifetime crash of -70%, -80% happens well then you have a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy at cheap prices and if history is any indication, markets wont crash -80% and then get into a V-shaped recovery. A recovery will take time which gives you enough time to scale back into the markets and build a new portfolio.\n\nTL;DR: It makes more sense to stay fully invested; if markets go up nice; if markets go down you can buy whenever you have cash available and if markets completely collapse well then its probably the best that can happen to you from an investment point of view. If markets go down that -70%, -80% it doesnt matter what you have invested because you will be able to build much more wealth from that point onwards over the next 20 years."

The problem is, this market can turn on a dime. Things have been pretty choppy. Who really knows how the market is going to behave next week. Some days start out nearly 100 percent green, and then an hour or so later and everything has gone red. Or vice versa. \n\nThus, I think trying to do a multiday swing trade, while still keeping your money safe from a complete market meltdown would be a super difficult task. The only way to really do it is to have a stop loss amount that you'd be willing to accept, and have a stop loss market order set. But then you have to decide your downside percentage that you're willing to accept. \n\nOf course, if you don't want to go the stop loss market order route (which is always quite dangerous when markets are so choppy), you can go the \"ride or die\" route. Which means, you just try to daytrade and swingtrade a stock that you're willing to hold for 5 years if things go really bad.\n\nHonestly, I think I like the idea of getting out of the market completely every single day before close. It will certainly limit the upside to very small percentage gains that you're able to snipe as a daytrader. But, if you have a lot of money that happened to be in cash, and you move the entire thing into daytrade plays, you can target very tiny percentage returns, to quickly jump in and out.

So the savings you get from Long Term Capital Gains rates being lower don't apply to them. \n\nIf you have a trader that does nothing but swing trades and sometimes daytrades, they are losing nothing tax wise, because they never would have enjoyed the long-term rates anyway. \n\nI can say that in my personal situation, I'm not doing any long-term holds right now, but I do plan to have 80 percent of my account in long-term holds in the not too distant future. The crucial thing for me with a long term hold is a proper entry. If you feel in your gut of guts that a sea of red is imminent, why not wait a little bit before entering long term holds? If you're right, you'll enter your long term play at a much better cost basis.\n\nConsider Facebook's stock for example. Two different investors could have entered FB this year with a long-term hold, that they're planning on holding for say 2 to 3 years, maybe longer. One investor happened to enter their long term hold back in March 2021. Maybe their entry price per share is $257. Another investor could have just gotten into investing in early September. Their entry price per share might have been $375. \n\nPretty huge difference between the two. Both are longterm bullish on FB, and both plan to hold for several years, maybe longer. \n\nYou can make an argument that in 5 or 6 years, the entry for each will hardly matter much to their bottom line. You're probably right.\n\nHowever, what if both of them decide to hold the stock for 18 months? Well, it's likely that the guy that entered at $257 will have a considerably better return than the guy at $375. 18 months isn't likely to be a long enough timeframe for their CB to not matter as much.\n\nI just want to have a good entry on my long-term plays, because I might not necessarily have 3 years or 5 years or 7 years.

Some publishers like Activision/Blizzard & Ubisoft have their own stores/launchers which they use instead of Steam, but they haven't been able to expand that to a general video game marketplace and become Steam competitors. These days you have to use their launchers for games they publish, but they've given up on trying to become a general digital game distribution platform.\n\nEpic has been trying with the Epic Store. In addition to Fortnite becoming exclusive to the Epic Store, Epic gave away lots of free games on their store, but as far as I can tell it hasn't caught on in the long term and they weren't able to retain a significant number of users after that.\n\nEpic had billions of dollars to spend on this; I doubt Amazon will succeed given what we saw with the Epic Store. Steam has a great reputation/image and has been the king of this space for a *long* time.\n\nSteam is targeted towards gamers, whereas Amazon has a lot of presence in the lives of the average person. But game places like those (Facebook had one, iirc) aren't really competitors to Steam. Also the audience of Twitch is mostly gamers, so if Amazon were to target normal people then there wouldn't be any synergy to exploit there."

I see both as considerably safer plays than BABA. The CCP seems to have a never ending vendetta against BABA. The continued Evergrande drama is something that will hold many Chinese stocks back due to all the uncertainty, but when the fear dies down temporarily, the quality Chinese stocks really go on a nice run. PDD is especially like this. If the Chinese stocks are all doing well for whatever reason, then PDD is normally one of the highest fliers. It's like a thoroughbred race horse that just can't wait to get on the track and let it all loose.\n\nI also like TSM, although the recent tensions with China are going to keep this stock in check for quite some time. There could be some great buying opportunities in TSM if you think all the China huffing and puffing is just that. Nothing more. But you might need a 3 year time horizon to really harvest the fruit.\n\nASML is another international play that I really love.

                "body": "Many mutual funds often have restrictions on initial purchase, so you can't just buy few shares, if you don't already own shares of it. But the way the trades happen is also different from ETFs, which trades similar to individual stocks. For one, you can't just set a minimum price limit and buy during a dip or sell during a spike in the middle of the day. You place an order to buy/sell, and it'll be executed at the end of the day, at whatever price it happens to close on the day. I recently sold the last of the mutual funds that I invested in over a decade ago. And I wasn't able to even set minimum sell price when I placed my order.\n\nThat along with what rhoadsalive said about mutual funds generally having higher operation fees, (though there are actively managed ETFs with high fees,) as well as higher broker commissions depending on which firm you use (you saw in the article you linked how they charge $40-80 per transaction, right?) make most mutual funds an out-of-fashion financial product that ETFs have largely replaced.\n\nThat said, many 401k products and other employee-sponsored retirement products only allow you to invest in limited selection of mutual funds (no individual stocks or ETFs available.) So you may be forced to invest in mutual funds. But like I said, if you're looking to invest in VOO or SCHD, both are ETFs, not mutual funds. I don't know about SCHD, but VOO and many of Vanguard's popular ETFs are already commission-free from most retail brokers.\n\nMy main point is that mutual funds and ETFs are two different financial products, and the article you linked are specific to mutual funds. So, sure, if you are looking to trade a specific Vanguard *mutual fund*, then you'll pay less in fees if you open an account with Vanguard directly. And Schwab and Fidelity both have their own set of mutual funds. But they each also offer ETF products."

Or is the real problem that \"Working Class\" people are fed up with either underpaid, undervalued, or having their sense of job security taken away. I mean honestly how dare the working class want something better. \n\nMost companies have not worked to create good company cultures. What I have seen over my working career in many industries is that employees are often undervalued by their managers and companies. Employees are not given clear paths for progression and have been beaten down with wage stagnation to protect and promote stock growth. Even at $40/hr our attrition rates are getting rough due to labor and wage practices.\n\nCurrent hiring practices are also to blame. Why do we have three interviews for a job that pays minimum wage? If you think that is bad, try applying for white collar or skilled jobs, where it takes not only multiple interviews, but MONTHS of waiting to find out if you got the job or not. Automated software is also to blame. It often removes dozens of valid candidates from the hiring lists in the attempt to find \"perfect\" candidates. \n\nThen comes 2020. Large sectors of the economy are labeled \"non-essential\" and are told to go home. In an instant, millions of people were told they are not an important part of the economy and their jobs could be taken away arbitrarily thus reducing their feelings of job security. \n\nAll of these factors and more have contributed to a massive amount of unfilled jobs. HR departments won't scrap non-working hiring practices, CEO's won't raise wages to attract talent, and our Government has yet make a concerted effort to regain public trust. \n\nDo I feel annoyed that people took the last few months to evaluate their participation in the workforce and aren't at Starbucks filling my order? Or do I understand that many took the time to create financial stability in other sectors and leave jobs where they were either undervalued, underpaid, or the government took their sense of job security?\n\n I do not feel sorry for companies that fail to recognize a shift in \"working class\" values. \n\nAlso, for the person who decided to make money off of investing and replaced their income, Good for you! I am glad you found a way to make income that you enjoy."

This theory anecdotally proves true: All of my parent's friends had part time jobs pre-covid that they worked alongside their regular jobs. Nothing draining, just fun jobs that they enjoyed but didn't want to make a career of. All of them, every one, took early retirement and quit their part time jobs during the pandemic. None of them have any intention of returning to work in any capacity - they are now traveling around the country in motorhomes or their own vehicles and enjoying retirement.

Making up for lost profit means you have to hire more people or operate in a more lean environment. The easiest solution for a company is to hire, but the abrupt layoffs followed by the need for more people than were originally employed is the recipe for a labor shortage.

Only time will tell, maybe it will bounce back, but my guess is that we're going to see at least a 2-5 year shortage of labor.\n\n- There was a massive retirement push at the beginning of COVID. I know at my IT division in my company we have about 800 employees. They had a voluntary severance program that was designed to push out near retirement folks to slim down expenses. We had 128 people take that program and move on, or most went into early retirement. I've also heard of a lot of folks who just didn't want to take the risk at their age and retired then. Boomers are starting to age out of the labor market one way or another and I think this will be a large factor going forward.\n\n- We've lost officially 700k, probably many more due to COVID. While many of those are older people who probably weren't in the labor market, there have been plenty of individuals who have died during traditional working years.\n\n- We're not even sure how many people long COVID is going to take out of the market yet. I don't have any evidence to support that this will be a noticeable factor here, but I'd be willing to bet it will factor in greatly in the coming years.\n\n- Certain sectors are quitting their jobs due to various reasons but mostly having to deal with the public during this time. I know a teacher who is taking a year off to watch her cousin's kid instead of teach. Medical staff are quitting left and right and possibly looking into either taking time off or switching careers which will require retraining, pulling them from the labor market for several years.\n\n- Many households that were two person working have slimmed down to one person working. Daycare is so egregiously expensive that if 1 person is making a non skilled labor wage and 1 person is, it often makes sense to have the lower wage person take time off to watch the kids until they can all go to school so they can scratch off the daycare expenses. Add on the fact that many office jobs can work from home now which incurs lower costs this is becoming more feasible for people."

Lots of daycares are still closed or understaffed or otherwise not affordable/available, so can't work without someone to watch the kids.  \n7. Lots of kids are still too young to get vaccinated, so their parents don't want to send them back to regular school just yet, so can't work when someone needs to be home with the kids during online-school.  \n8. And actually, school just let out for the summer, so that's even more reason for somebody to need to be home to watch the kids right now.  \n9.

Companies want to encourage customers to come in by offering special deals and coupons with the hope this will bring them back again to pay full price but this doesn't happen since customers just wait until the new deal or coupon. So the company does more deals and more coupons. Sure, they're coming in more often now but when they do they're paying 25% less. \n\n(By the way, for you civilians out there that don't know, BOGO coupons are forged in the fires of the fourth circle of hell. If you ever come across one you need to douse it in holy water, cut it up into tiny pieces, and burn those pieces to ash if you value your eternal soul.)\n\nSo you're stuck now. You're getting 25% more business for the same revenue you were before but your labor goal is the same as it always was. The company won't change the goal because if they did they wouldn't turn a profit. Managers won't increase wages because if they did they'd have to cut hours (and probably have to do the vacated hourly position themselves). Customers won't pay full price now because they don't ever need to and likely are getting a worse experience for it (and a bigger discount \"as an apology\"). \n\nEmployees are working harder with A) less staff (or a manager working that spot), B) fewer tips since the bills are lower and (generally) C) more difficult customers that are coming in solely because they're trying to pay as little actual money as the restaurant will allow.\n\nSide note: these \"difficult customers\" can be literally anyone. I've argued with more people driving cars worth 6 figures over why their free burger coupon doesn't work with the $28 steak they ordered than I care to admit. And no, I can't just discount the bill for the price of the burger.\n\nSo when 2020 hit and all these employees making barely enough to pay their rent (that they have to split between roommates) were out of a job and had nowhere to go to find another one.\n\nSo they left for good. They realized they didn't have to get harassed because the steak they just sent out that is warm and pink all the way through was \"raw\" and \"any good cook knows medium has just a hint of pink\" to get a paycheck. Or they don't have to go back and smile at table 44 with the creepy old dude that keeps asking them to sit on their lap and making comments about how he wishes girls looked like them when he was younger because if they just suck it up maybe he'll leave 20% on their $24 bill (hint: he won't).\n\nAnd I haven't even begun to touch on the shady, skeevy, and occasionally outright predatory managers out there that pretty much everyone that has worked in a restaurant, myself included, has ever had the displeasure of working for.\n\nSo TL:DR....\n\nDon't be frustrated at \"all these lazy people sitting at home on the government's dime\" when your favorite spot is closed to give their employees a break for a day or two. Blame the people who demand to pay the same price for a sandwich they did in 1997 and the companies that enable them by handing out enough discounts often enough that they never actually have to pay full menu price and, on the rare occasion they don't have a deal going on, send out $50 gift cards to basically anyone that sends an email to customer relations saying the employees were \"rude and unhelpful\" because they wouldn't accept the 2 year old coupon they dug out of their purse.\n\nIf you didn't already notice, this \"lazy people not working\" talking point frustrates the everloving shit out of me. I love my job and I'm defensive - probably to a fault - of my employees. I've worked with some really incredible people over the years and I can probably count on just one hand the number I think were happy to just sit at home collecting a paycheck over the last year and a half. You will be hard pressed to find any group of people that work harder in such high stress (and often dangerous/abusive) environments for so little reward.\n\nAnd if you don't believe me, go work at one and find out for yourself. I'm sure they're hiring.\n\nPre-post edit: I'm not ranting at the comment I'm responding to since I agree with them wholeheartedly. I just started writing and every word was more cathartic than the last so I just kept going.

I did have an epiphany about ten years ago, when I started to understand how much employers were charging for my experience and talent vs what they were paying me. So, I took a very mercenary/capitalist approach that has paid off pretty well. Instead of spending my free time giving the company freebies to make them look good, I started spending that time looking for better paid positions. I do try to work with employers to get fair pay increases that keep up with inflation, but this has been an uphill battle with minimal results. \n\nIt has been far better for me to actively seek better pay pretty much daily, and to not hesitate to make a move when it makes financial sense. Now I change jobs every two years or so, and include that in my planning. I have many versions of my CV and review perhaps 20 possible new positions every day. I am reasonably happy with my current employer and salary, but I have an interview on Wednesday that could increase my pay by 20%.\n\nI think that at least part of the slack in the labor market is due to people smelling the coffee - corporations are not loyal to you, will give you the worst deal you will accept, and will drop you like hot garbage for a few dollars worth of short term gain. As more of us understand this, more of us realize that seeking a better deal on our own through changing employers requires a long term skill set that must be maintained. These days, I'm an expert who knows how to ace interviews and sell my CV. I'm a good negotiator for myself and know what I want from my job. I understand the market and have successfully followed trends to benefit myself. I think that many others are starting to do this kind of thing, and it's one source of lag in the jobs data."

Someone who was fired for cause can be just as unemployed as someone laid off for no fault of their own.

In other words, parents were still staying home to watch the kids, but people weren't falling out of the unemployment numbers enough to meaningfully move the needle.\n\nContrast this with the actual [graph of the unemployment rate](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm), and you see a lot of people ceasing to be unemployed without leaving the labor force. What this implies, but is more explicitly shown in reverse by a [graph of employment numbers](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-employment.htm) is that people who lost their jobs found new ones.\n\nSo yes, there is a vast world of labor statistics that you would do well to read more about, but no, that isn't a meaningful objection here. The unemployment rate does, in fact, tell us what happened. Namely, that people got new jobs, and the vast untapped reservoir of unemployed workers simply isn't there."

The position was advertised as $17/hr full time with benefits, so I applied. *After* the interview and orientation, the paperwork said $14 part time, so I asked the supervisor what the hell.\n\nI was told, \u201cOh, yes, we\u2019ll be spending the next few weeks finding out who among this batch of 40 people we just hired will stick around through the first days of hard work. After that, we take on whoever we are doing a good job.\u201d\n\nWell, they were the only game in town and I was drowning in debt, so I signed and worked that month. Even minimum wage is something when paired with OT.\n\nI built that store from floor to ceiling, never dodged a shift, worked fast and safe, hauled every load off every truck, did my time.\n\nStore opens, a week goes by, no nothing. I ask about when I get taken on at $17/hr. By then, the 40 new hires were reduced down to ten including me. The rest were either *brand* new or veterans brought in from other stores.\n\nI was told \u201cOh, it\u2019ll happen when it happens, there\u2019s a process, etc etc.\u201d\n\n$14/hr for 16 hours a week is not something I can survive on. It just means I can\u2019t help my wife out at home and with her business. Disrupts my life and leaves me in debt.\n\nBut hey. Only game in town.\n\nAnother month passes. I\u2019m still hauling shit off the trucks, still hauling furniture from the back to the store front, still up selling and helping customers and so on. I ask again- when am I taken on full time at $17/hr as promised?\n\nOnce again, I was brushed off. I got the general sense talking with the veteran store workers being carted in from out of town that Hobby Lobby only hires people on after a few years of loyalty shown on a part time schedule.\n\nSo that next Friday (the day the trucks come in and restock and when it\u2019s all hands on deck), I ditched work to go to a job interview instead. Interview went so well, I just didn\u2019t show up again.\n\nFuck \u2018em. If I had had nothing to lose, I\u2019d have gone back one night and sent bricks through their front windows out of spite."

One of China's biggest weaknesses is their demographics, the [fertility rate there in 2020](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-society-census-fertility-idUSL4N2MY140) might have been 1.3, lower than Japan's. The cost of raising a child in China is certainly lower than in the U.S. but as a proportion to income, it's much more expensive. In short time, China could be burdened with a demographic crisis. In [5 years](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1204581.shtml) China could have 300 million senior citizens. So Chinese government leadership saw they needed to make a change, so they implemented the 3 red lines policy, for real estate speculation. They also implemented changes on private tutoring. The similarities here are that both of these industries involve costs to raising a child.\n\nWith the crackdown on real estate speculation, I expect some Chinese speculators will have to sell real estate they've purchased in the United States. At the same time, WFH policies that were enacted will impact commercial real estate quite a lot here. When we see some of the commercial real estate repurposed, some probably for housing, we could see weakness in residential real estate. If speculation continues in residential real estate and makes it even more unaffordable, I think we'd see some federal intervention into local zoning regulations, which I think is the largest barrier to building affordable housing. \n\nSo overall, I think real estate won't outperform the S&P 500 over the next 10 years. But still will be attractive to individuals since it's the only asset that you can leverage 5:1 as was mentioned else where in this thread."

The US already has a sub-replacement fertility rate, but not only that, in a couple decades or sooner the US sub-replacement rate will nonetheless be higher than all of Central and South America and pretty all of Asia. That\u2019s at least what the trends are telling us. You can\u2019t lean on immigration when population starts falling everywhere. So yes, the people who are buying houses (demand) need to exist for the market to maintain increasing prices. A lot can happen between now and then though and who knows about the timing. If you want real estate prices to go up for longer, vote for politicians who will implement liberal immigration policies for Subsaharan Africa, as that will be last major source of immigrants in a few decades."

Joe - shmoes in secondary markets will still be renting, perhaps moreso if the economy pulls back and single family residential (SFR) delinquency rates increases.\n\nFurthermore, look up \"filtering theory\" as it relates to housing stock. New stuff built, rich people move to that, rich hand me downs go to the next tier down, and the oldest and least viable housing becomes obsolete. Which is to say through the life cycle of housing supply ends up being commensurate with demand. A significant declination in demand without a corresponding reduction in supply, as you suggest, would not occur dramatically unless millions of people fell off the face of the country.

The concept is interesting, but there isn't much detail on the exact methodology of the algorithms that are controlling the portfolio weighting behind the scenes. Darren Schuringa appears to have a long history managing ETFs and I haven't found anything that would turn me off from him as a fund manager yet. He's been doing a lot of pieces with different news orgs to promote the ETF, with one of the key selling points being that it's a hedge during bear markets to allow for some upside, and that it is best utilized as a long term core of a retirement investment strategy. One thing I'm definitely not keen on is the expense ratio, coming in at a whopping 0.95% at the moment, way more than I'd normally go for on an ETF. \n\nCurious if anyone here has insights or thoughts on the fund, or it's use as a hedged store for long term growth."

Click [here](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2020.pdf) for the most recent one.\n\nPage 9 has one of the most important tables. In any given year, some active funds will outperform and some will underperform. Many people think they can select winning active funds by simply picking funds that have performed well in the past. Unfortunately, there is no reliable way to predict which active funds will outperform in the future. Last year's report found that 60% of actively managed large cap funds underperformed their benchmark index in the trailing year. In the trailing 5 years, 75% underperformed, and in the trailing 20 years, 94% underperformed. The results for small and mid cap funds were nearly as bad: 88% of active small cap and active mid cap funds underperformed their benchmark over the past 20 years.\n\nIf your friend picked funds that outperformed the S&P 500 or the total market, most likely he was in a growth fund. First, it's important to understand that he may have not outperformed growth index funds. Over the trailing 20 years, 96.5% of active large cap growth funds underperformed their benchmark.\n\nI'm sure your friend feels good having picked a fund that performed well. But the evidence indicates that there is not a reliable way to select the rare few active funds that outperform. I would be willing to bet a lot of money that whatever active fund he picked will underperform if he continues holding it.

                "body": "If you're looking for investment products as straightforward as those, you can't go wrong with just choosing the main funds from the largest asset managers like Vanguard and BlackRock. For total US they are [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VTI) and [ITOT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239724/ishares-core-sp-total-us-stock-market-etf); for total international they are [VXUS](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VXUS) and [IXUS](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/244048/ishares-core-msci-total-international-stock-etf); and for aggregate US bonds they are [BND](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BND) and [AGG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf).\n\nHowever, you can invest in a more diversified portfolio with fewer funds. The standard total US bond portfolio excludes more than half of the world's bonds: you can invest in a total global bond fund with Vanguard's [BNDW](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BNDW). You can also invest in the global stock market in one low-cost fund with Vanguard's [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT). So all you really need is VT and BNDW.\n\nEven more, you can combine these two funds into all-in-one funds. Both Vanguard and BlackRock have funds that allow you to invest in various allocations (80/20, 60/40, etc.) To invest in Vanguard's [all-in-one funds](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/lifestrategy), you have to use a Vanguard brokerage account because they're offered only as mutual funds. I don't recommend this because their website is clunky. But to invest in ETFs like those above, you can use any brokerage account, like one with Schwab, Fidelity, or E\\*Trade. BlackRock's all-in-one ETFs have four allocations: [80/20](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239729/ishares-aggressive-allocation-etf), [60/40](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239756/ishares-growth-allocation-etf), [40/60](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239765/ishares-moderate-allocation-etf), and [30/70](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239733/ishares-conservative-allocation-etf). Investing in these gives you a globally diversified, automatically rebalanced portfolio with your preferred ratio of stocks to bonds.\n\nFor more info on index investing, I'd recommend reading [this](https://github.com/investindex/Intro). It's a guide I've written for beginners that compiles helpful resources as well as my own explanations of the optimal ways to invest, based on scientific research on asset pricing. One major finding I would highlight is that simply investing in a global fund like VT is not the most diversified stock portfolio. This sounds counterintuitive -- how could you diversify more than a fund that invests in nearly every stock in the world? The approach is called risk factor diversification, and it's explained in [this section](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio) of the guide. Like geographic diversification, it will increase your expected return and lower the volatility you're likely to experience. If you're already familiar with the differences between ETFs and mutual funds, and how to evaluate the risks of your investment, you could read that section. If not, I'd recommend starting at the beginning.\n\nPlease feel free to ask if you have more questions."

I don't think inflation is an important variable, because it hurts the purchasing power of your stock market gains as much as it helps you by diluting your debt.\n\nThe main consideration here is left tail risk: what are the worst things that could happen in your life that could leave you unable to meet your debt obligations? What if: the stock market fell by 50%, you lost your job, and perhaps you even encountered another expensive misfortune like a health crisis? This would of course be unlucky, but it's important to think about how this could go wrong.\n\nIf (1) you feel that you're secure enough to take on this level of debt voluntarily, and (2) you can psychologically tolerate investing in a portfolio aggressive enough to make the interest payments worth it (ideally 100% stock funds), then yes, mathematically this makes sense.\n\nIf you don't want to hold a 100% stock portfolio with the full $80K, then perhaps you could pay off some of the debt and invest the remainder in stocks. If you choose to invest some in bonds, this is questionable because it makes you both long and short on debt."

That way, you have a good chance to beat any reasonable amount of inflation and might do much better if the stock pick is good and you hold on. Also the nice thing about having your financial wealth barbelled is since you're 90% in cash and 10% invested (at the beginning atleast, before your investment appreciates 50% or 1,000%), you won't get stressed out no matter what happens in regards to what's outside of your direct control (the performance of your investment, the broad market taking a dump).\n\nAlso with all that cash you will be able to buy when there is real market crash, or a particular stock gets real cheap on a dollars-to-donuts basis."

If you withdraw from the market, it might just continue to grow and then even when it \"crashes\" the new bottom may be lower than today's value. \n\nEven the bottom of the COVID dip barely hit 2016 prices and it recovered in months. Withdrawing is a play to try to time the market now, believing we are currently near a peak, and then again after a crash when you believe it has dropped enough to be near the bottom. Personally I don't feel like anyone should be confident in their ability to do this successfully, but you can always go for the gamble"

So of the 8 things listed 7 have to do with inflation.  Which points to your last point  \"more dollar value inflation this year than I'm aware of in any year ever.\"  Your premise is wrong. Take a look at inflation in the 70s. It averaged nearly 7% for the decade, including exceeding double digit inflation twice. Despite this and a nearly 2 year bear market that saw a draw done of nearly 50% the stock market was up overall for decade. \n\nThe only other point you make not relating to inflation is civil unrest. Sure it sucks right now but it is nothing compared to the 60s.  The market was again up for the decade starting in 1960. \n\nIf you look at a chart of historical returns since 1900 the market has gone only one direction - up. This is reddit investing, I assume most people on here invest for the long term.  In which case I stand by what I said.  If you are trading, then sure, these might be issues to think about for short term returns. \n\nI assume you are young, if so, take it from this middle aged old fart. Just put money in a market index month after month regardless of market conditions. You will do better than most. If you like to goof around with individual stocks keep it to a small percentage of your portfolio. I have about 10% invested in individual stocks."

There's more going on than just those two things. Government support has mostly ended, and there does not seem to be a big return to work. Increased wages does not fully address the problem either.\n\nFront line workers have been hit hard by the pandemic, and a lot of them have simply died of Covid. Others took the year off to move into other careers, and awareness of the conditions, especially employee abuse from customers, has taken a toll on worker confidence.\n\nI'm confident a lot of those workers are just never coming back.\n\n> Supply shortages will also resolve over time as producers are trying to ramp up production and continue to even out the shock of last year through their systems\n\nI think this is true, but not the whole picture. I've seen predictions that shortages will last well into 2022, and perhaps longer.
